<p align="centr"><h1>Ila Sachani</h1></p><br>
<hr>
<p align="centre"> <h3>Ila Sachani was born in Gujarat in the surat zilla to a family of farmers. She is a person who found herself in an unfortunate situation at birth when it was found that her arms fell loose. Growing up, this gave rise to a lot of problems as she couldn't do simple tasks like plucking flowers and writing on slates like the other children. She, at a young age, wondered  why she wasn't like the others around her.</h3></p>
<p align="centre"><h3>She kept trying to face these challenges but with passing time, things just got a lot harder. She now had to do dangerous tasks like chopping fruits and vegetables and her condition was getting worse. But no! What did you think? SHE WASN'T GOING TO GIVE UP JUST YET! She tried to heal herself and went to many doctors but her condition showed no improvement.</h3></p>
<p align="centre"><h3>After a lot of hardwork and practice she finally managed to do everything with her feet. With the help and support of her grandmother and mother, Ila learned many types of embroidery like lucknavi, Kashmiri, hachchh etc. She did embroidery so well using just her feet that when her work was presented, everyone liked her work so much that due to her amazing ability, she won many prizes and even had a chance to go to foreign countries to display her work. She is now considered one of the best, even though she had to endure many challenges, inspiring people worldwide.</h3></p>
<p align="centre"><h3>What I learned from this amazing journey is that if you have a dream you want to achieve, a dream you hold dear, very dear, there is always a way to make them come true. These challenges faced by Ila shows everyone how they all have an ember, a talent inside which you just have to ignite and no one is any lesser than the other,  no matter the challenges, difficulties, or insecurities they face. To me, everyone in this world of ours is alike, whether a youth or senior and I hope everyone soon sees that as well. And remember, you can ALWAYS achieve your goals!</h3></p>
