<p style="color:yellow; font-size:40px"><u><i>What was India's contribution to satellite technology through communication satellites and regional GPS systems?</i></u></p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">ISRO over the past six decades has contributed and invested into many successful Space
Programmes. The hallmark of Indian Space Programme is the application-oriented focus
and the benefits that have accrued to the country through these programmes. ISRO is a dream planet of late Dr Vikram Sarabhai now a reality living throughout the
country in almost every state serving as instrumental centres and infrastructures. The
outstanding technological feat of the human race triggered new advanced scientific and
technological developments for the betterment for the common man and nation.
The marvels of Indian Satellites are designed and developed by the minds that feed on
curiosity and innovation. SITE (Satellite Instructional Television Experiment), the largest
mass communications experiment ever carried out in the world. SITE was followed by the
Satellite Telecommunication Experimental Project (STEP) in 1977-79. Later, SITE and STEP
paved the way for INSAT, the Indian National Satellite System, the backbone of Satellite
Communication in India today. The following are satellites that revolutionised satellite technology:-</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">1)The Chandrayaan-3:-</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">Chandrayaan-3 is India’s third lunar mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on July 14, 2023. The mission aimed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon’s south polar region and deploy a rover for surface exploration. The mission was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on July 14,
 2023.
 The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on August 5, 2023,
and successfully touched down near the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023, making India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and the first to do so in this challenging region. After the landing, the Pragyan rover was deployed and explored approximately 100 meters of the lunar surface, conducting experiments and sending valuable data back to Earth.
 There was confirmation of the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface; detection of sulfur and other elements in the lunar soil, providing insights into the Moon’s geological history.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">2)INSAT:-</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) is one of the
largest Domestic Communication Satellite Systems
in the Asia-Pacific region with nine operational
Communication Satellites placed in Geostationary
Orbit. INSAT system provides services with more than
200 transponders in the C, Extended C and Ku-bands
to Telecommunications, Television Broadcasting,
Satellite Newsgathering, Societal Applications,
GSAT-31 GSAT-2 GSAT-9
INSAT-4CR.Weather Forecasting, Disaster Warning and Search & Rescue Operations, Radio Networking,
Mobile Satellite Services, Telemedicine, Tele-education, Village Resource Centre (VRC),
Direct-to-Home Services (DTH) throughout the country.
A few satellites in the INSAT System are GSAT-6, 7, 7A, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 29, 31,30, 24 and CMS-01.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">3)IRS:-</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite System was
commissioned with the launch of IRS-1A. India has one of the
largest constellations of Operational Remote Sensing Satellites.
A few Earth Observation satellites are OCEANSAT-2,
RESOURCESAT-2, MEGHA-TROPIQUES, SARAL, INSAT-3D,
RESOURCESAT-2A, SCATSAT-1, INSAT-3DR, CARTOSAT-2E,
CARTOSAT-3, RISAT-2BR1, EOS-1, EOS-4, EOS-2, EOS-6, INS-2B,
EOS-7, INSAT-3DS.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">4)IRNSS:-</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">India became the 4th country to offer Space-based Satellite Navigation Services. IRNSS is anIndependent Regional Navigation Satellite System being developed by India. It provides two
types of Services – Standard Positioning Service (SPS) which is provided to all the users and
Restricted Service (RS). RS is an encrypted service provided only to authorised users.
The IRNSS Constellation was named as “NavIC” (Navigation with Indian Constellation) by the
Honourable Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and dedicated to the nation on the occasion of the
successful launch of the IRNSS-1G Satellite.
It is designed to provide Accurate Position Information Service to users in India as well as the
region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary. </p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">NavIC Applications</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Terrestrial, Aerial and Marine
Navigation</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Disaster Management</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Vehicle Tracking and Fleet
Management</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Integration with Mobile Phones</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Precise Timing</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Mapping and Geodetic Data Capture</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Terrestrial Navigation aid for Hikers
and Travellers</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">• Visual and Voice Navigation for
Drivers</p>

<p style="color:yellow;font-size:30px"><u><i>How are indian satellites helpful in weather forcasting, navigation and disaster management?</i></u></p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) is a constellation of geostationary satellites that provide essential services such as telecommunications, broadcasting, weather monitoring, and disaster management. INSAT satellites have been critical in connecting remote areas, enabling television and radio broadcasting, and meeting a variety of communication needs.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">INSAT satellites are equipped with meteorological payloads that provide real-time weather data and support weather forecasting and monitoring.
This information is crucial for predicting weather patterns, cyclones, and natural disasters, aiding in disaster management and preparedness.</p><br>
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:30px"><u><i>Conclusion:-</i></u></p>
<p style="color:white;font-size:25px">The data collected from these satellites are used for several applications covering Agriculture,
Water Resources, Urban Planning, Rural Development, Mineral Prospecting, Environment,
Forestry, Ocean Resources and Disaster Management.
The satellites are instrumental in providing necessary data in diversi ed Spatial, Spectral and
Temporal Resolutions required in the nation as well as globally. In the field of Agriculture, IRS
data is used for Crop Health Monitoring, Crop Yield Estimation, Groundwater Potential Zone
Mapping, Mineral Targeting Tasks etc. Potential Fishing Zone Identification and Coastal Zone
Mapping are some of the ocean applications that are also the gifts of IRS.</p>
